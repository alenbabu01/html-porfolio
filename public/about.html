<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I’m a final-year BTech Computer Science student with a strong foundation in Python 
  programming and a keen interest in machine learning and web development. Through academic
   projects and an internship at Codedesign Technologies Pvt Ltd, I’ve gained hands-on experience 
   in developing real-world solutions and working in collaborative environments. Known for being 
   disciplined and consistent—both in academics and personal growth—I bring a balance of technical 
   proficiency and a growth mindset. I'm actively seeking opportunities to apply my skills,
    learn from experienced professionals, and contribute meaningfully to innovative tech-driven teams.
